# Python Basics Repository

This repository is a collection of fundamental Python programs covering a wide range of topics and concepts. These programs serve as learning resources for Python beginners and provide examples of common Python programming constructs.

## Program List

- **Calculator**: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Class**: Demonstrates the creation and usage of Python classes.
- **Decorator**: Shows how to use decorators to modify or enhance the behavior of functions.
- **Dictionary (Dict)**: Illustrates the use of dictionaries in Python, a key-value data structure.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides examples of how to handle exceptions and errors in Python using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` statements.
- **Functions**: Covers the basics of defining and calling functions in Python.
- **Lambda Functions**: Explains lambda functions (anonymous functions) and their usage.
- **List**: Demonstrates working with Python lists, a versatile data structure.
- **Loops**: Covers different types of loops in Python, including `for` and `while` loops.
- **Map Function**: Explains the `map()` function and how to apply it to a sequence of data.
- **Secret Code**: An example of a simple program that encodes and decodes secret messages.
- **Tables**: Prints multiplication tables for a specified number.
- **Tuple**: Demonstrates working with Python tuples, an immutable data structure.

## Running the Programs

Each program is self-contained and can be run independently. To execute a Python program, follow these general steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the program's directory using the `cd` command.

4. Run the program using the `python` command followed by the program's filename (replace `ProgramName.py` with the actual program's filename):

   ```bash
   python ProgramName.py
   ```

Replace `ProgramName` with the name of the Python file you want to execute.
